# FCFS scheduling-algorithms

For FCFS scheduling algorithm, read the number of processes/jobs in the system,
their CPU burst times. The scheduling is performed on the basis of arrival time of
the processes irrespective of their other parameters. Each process will be executed
according to its arrival time. Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time of each
of the processes accordingly.

ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Get the input process and their burst time.
Step 3: Sort the processes based on order in which it requests CPU.
Step 4: Compute the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
Step 5: Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
Step 6: Print the details about all the processes.
Step 7: Stop the program.
