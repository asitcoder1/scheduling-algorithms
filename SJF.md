# SJF scheduling-algorithms

For SJF scheduling algorithm, read the number of processes/jobs in the system, their
CPU burst times. Arrange all the jobs in order with respect to their burst times.
There may be two jobs in queue with the same execution time, and then FCFS
approach is to be performed. Each process will be executed according to the length of
its burst time. Then calculate the waiting time and turnaround time of each of the
processes accordingly.

ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Get the input process and their burst time.
Step 3: Sort the processes based on burst time.
Step 4: Compute the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
Step 5: Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
Step 6: Print the details about all the processes.
Step 7: Stop the program.
